# Climate Data Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze historical climate data to understand patterns, trends, and relationships between various meteorological variables. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis, visualization, and modeling to gain insights into past climate conditions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains historical climate data collected from weather stations over several years. It includes information such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. The dataset is provided in CSV format and covers multiple locations and time intervals.

### Data Source
- Dataset Name: [Climate Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/die9origephit/temperature-data-albany-new-york)


## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Preparation**: The raw dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and formatting issues. This ensures that the data is clean and ready for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Various visualizations such as time series plots, histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps are created to explore the data. Insights are derived regarding temperature trends, precipitation distribution, and correlations between variables.

3. **Modeling**: Statistical models such as linear regression, ARIMA, and machine learning algorithms are applied to forecast future climate trends based on historical data. Model performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
git clone
```bash
https://github.com/priyankav-27/CVIP_Datascience_phasetask2.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts located in the `notebooks/` and `scripts/` directories, respectively, to perform data analysis.

4. Explore the results and visualizations generated in the `results/` directory.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into historical climate patterns and trends, which can be useful for various applications such as climate monitoring, urban planning, and disaster preparedness. The analysis findings contribute to a better understanding of the Earth's climate system and its impact on society and the environment.
